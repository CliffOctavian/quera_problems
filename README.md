# Coding Exercise
This repository contains solution to coding challanges from several websites
for that purpose. Packages are divided based on the website from which the
problems are drawn. Most of the problems are algorithmic, some of them are
technological, like Django, Bash, and SQL.


## Leetcode
----------
* There is three packages for each class of problems; easy, medium and hard.
* The name of each file denotes the official name of the algorithm problem
  in the website.
* Each file may contain a test following pytest framework considering the
  complexity of the problem.


## Quera
---------------

* This repository contains my solutions to problems from quera.org website.
* Currently there are solutions in two sections: djago problems and algorithm
  problems.
* I chose to write the code using Python3 language in a type-safe manner.
* Each module is named after the number associated to the problem in the
  website.
* The link to the page for that problem is also available in each module.
